## What This Tool Does

When uploaded to a session, this tool instructs the AI to produce a loose, directional brief — not a precise handoff. The output captures the essence of what's being built, the aesthetic and technical territory explored, and the open creative space that remains.

The new AI receiving this document should understand the problem deeply enough to suggest new directions, not just continue the existing one.

## Instructions For The AI Producing The Summary

Generate a riff document using the structure below. Write it as a creative and technical brief, not a status report. Capture intent and feeling as much as facts. The goal is orientation, not reconstruction.

## Riff Document Structure

### The Problem
What is actually being built or solved? One short paragraph. Include:
- The core thing
- Who it's for or what it's part of
- The feeling or quality it should have when done right

---

### The Territory
A honest map of what's been explored:

**What worked** — approaches, decisions, or directions that felt right. Include why they worked, not just what they were.

**What didn't work** — approaches that were tried and rejected. Be specific about why — "looked wrong", "caused artifacts", "felt generic" are all valid reasons. This prevents the new session from retreading dead ground.

**What was left unexplored** — directions that were considered but never tried, or ideas that came up but weren't pursued.

---

### The Aesthetic
The visual, tonal, or qualitative direction that emerged during the session. This is the hardest thing to reconstruct from code or notes alone — capture it here:
- What does it look like or feel like right now?
- What should it look like or feel like when it's done?
- Any references, comparisons, or descriptions that helped calibrate direction

---

### Constraints That Matter
Technical or creative constraints that aren't negotiable — the things any new approach must respect. Keep this list short. Only include constraints that genuinely shaped decisions, not just the full stack declaration.

---

### Open Space
What's still undefined, undecided, or wide open. This is where the new session has room to go. Frame these as possibilities, not problems:
- What could this become that it isn't yet?
- What's the most interesting unresolved question?
- What would make this genuinely surprising?

---

### Suggested Starting Point
One concrete suggestion for where a fresh session could begin. Not necessarily where the last session left off — could be a completely different angle that the work so far suggests.

## How To Use The Output

Start a new session with:
```
[upload SYSTEM.md]
[upload relevant skill files]
[upload this riff document]

here's where i've been — let's find a new angle
```

The AI will read the riff document, orient itself to the territory, and propose 2-3 directions worth exploring before asking which to pursue.
