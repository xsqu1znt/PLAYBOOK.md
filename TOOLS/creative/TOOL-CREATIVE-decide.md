## What This Tool Does

When uploaded to a session, this tool instructs the AI to facilitate a structured creative decision. Unlike technical decisions, creative decisions involve taste, audience, brand, and feeling — not just logic. This tool brings rigour to that process without stripping out the creative judgment.

Use this when you're stuck between two directions and need a peer-level creative opinion, not just a pros/cons list.

---

## Instructions For The AI Facilitating The Decision

If the options aren't already described, ask:
1. What are the options being considered?
2. What does the end result need to make someone feel?
3. Who is the audience and what do they respond to?
4. Are there any hard constraints that rule out certain directions?

Then produce the decision framework. End with a clear recommendation. If it genuinely depends on something, name exactly what that thing is.

## Decision Framework Structure

### The Decision
State what's being decided in one sentence. Be specific — "which headline to use" is better than "the copy direction."

---

### Audience Gut-Check
Before comparing options, confirm who this is for. A direction that works brilliantly for one audience can completely miss another. State:
- Who the primary audience is
- What they already believe or feel about this topic
- What they distrust or would roll their eyes at

Use this to filter options that would land wrong regardless of quality.

---

### Side By Side

For each option:

```
OPTION [X]: [Name or short description]

Feeling:     What emotion or reaction does this produce?
Strength:    Where this option is at its best
Weakness:    Where this option fails or feels wrong
Audience fit: How well it lands with the confirmed audience
Longevity:   Will this feel dated in 12 months?
Risk:        What could go wrong if this direction is chosen
```

---

### The Tension
Name the real creative tension between the options. Not just "A is safe, B is bold" — what is actually being traded off? Examples:
- Clarity vs intrigue
- Warmth vs authority
- Familiarity vs surprise
- Broad appeal vs strong point of view

The tension is often the most useful thing to name — it reframes the decision as a values choice, not just a taste choice.

---

### Reference Check
For each option, name a real-world example (brand, campaign, film, publication) that made a similar choice. Did it work? Why or why not? This grounds the decision in precedent rather than speculation.

---

### The Recommendation

```
RECOMMENDED: [Option X]
BECAUSE: [The core creative argument — 2-3 sentences]
FOR THIS AUDIENCE: [Why it lands specifically for them]
WATCH OUT FOR: [The one way this direction can go wrong in execution]
IF YOU DISAGREE: [What to consider instead and why]
```

---

### What Makes It Work In Execution
A recommendation is only useful if it can be executed well. For the recommended option, name:
- The one thing that must be true for this to land
- The one thing that would kill it even if the direction is right

---

## Notes For The AI

- Creative decisions are not purely logical — gut reaction and taste are valid inputs, not things to engineer away
- If both options are genuinely equal, say so and suggest a third direction rather than forcing a false choice
- Never recommend the safe option just because it's safe — safety has a cost too
- If the user has a strong instinct toward one option, explore why before overriding it — they may know something about the audience or context that changes the recommendation
- Reference real examples wherever possible — abstract creative advice is harder to act on than grounded comparisons
