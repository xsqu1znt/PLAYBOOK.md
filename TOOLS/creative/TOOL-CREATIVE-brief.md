## What This Tool Does

When uploaded to a session, this tool instructs the AI to take whatever the user provides — a rough idea, a brain dump, a chaotic conversation, a vague feeling — and distill it into a clean creative brief that can open a new session, brief a collaborator, or serve as a north star for the project.

The brief should be tight enough to give clear direction and loose enough to leave room for creativity.

---

## Instructions For The AI Producing The Brief

Read everything the user provides. Ask one clarifying question only if something critical is genuinely missing — not to fill in details, but to resolve ambiguity that would produce a wrong brief. Then produce the brief in the structure below.

Write the brief as if briefing a talented creative who has never heard of this project. It should give them everything they need to start and nothing they don't.

---

## Brief Structure

### Project Name
A short working title. Not necessarily the final name — just something to refer to it by.

---

### The One-Liner
One sentence that captures what this is. Not a tagline — a description. Should answer: what is it, who is it for, and what makes it distinct.

---

### The Problem
What problem is this solving, or what desire is it fulfilling? Be specific about the person experiencing the problem — not a demographic, a human with a specific frustration or want.

---

### The Goal
What does success look like? One primary goal. Can include 1-2 secondary goals but the primary must be clear.

---

### The Audience
Who is this actually for? Not a target demographic — a specific, vivid description of the person who will use or experience this. What do they care about? What do they already know? What do they distrust?

---

### The Feeling
How should this make someone feel when they experience it? Not what they should think — what they should feel. 3-5 words or short phrases.

---

### The Tone
The voice and manner of the project. Reference 2-3 real-world examples (brands, films, publications, artists) that capture the tone — not as things to copy, but as calibration points.

---

### What It Is Not
3-5 things this project should never look, sound, or feel like. Anti-references are as important as references for keeping creative work on track.

---

### Constraints
Any hard constraints — technical, budgetary, timeline, brand, legal, or otherwise. Only include real constraints, not preferences.

---

### Open Questions
Anything that's still genuinely undefined and needs a decision before work can begin. Keep this short — if there are more than 3-4 open questions, the brief isn't ready yet.

---

### Suggested First Step
The single most productive thing to do next. Specific and actionable.

## Notes For The AI

- A brief that tries to say everything says nothing — edit ruthlessly
- If the user's input is contradictory, surface the contradiction and ask which direction to take rather than averaging between them
- The brief should feel like it has a point of view — not a neutral summary of everything the user said
- If the input is genuinely too thin to brief from, say so and ask the three most important questions before producing anything
- Never invent constraints or audience details that weren't provided or implied — flag gaps instead
